- 4 corn tortillas (small-ish size)
- Sriracha aioli - we like this one from Stonewall Kitchen

For the sausages and eggs:

- 2 vegetarian sausages - I like field roast spicy Mexican chipotle, Natalie prefers field smoked apple and sage - or LOVEs the field roast apple and maple little sausages, where we use 4 instead of 2
- 4 eggs
- Tablespoon of mirin
- Dashes of Cholula

For the avocado sauce:

- One avocado
- A handfull of cilantro
- Gourmet garden stir in garlic paste (or real garlic)
- Juice of half a lime
- Just under a quarter cup olive oil
- A food processor

Once you get the hang of it the whole thing takes 15 minutes to make

For the avocado sauce:

- Halve avocado, remove pip, scoop out the two halves into the food processor
- Add a handfull of cilantro, one tablespoon garlic, juice of half a lime, 1/4 teaspoon salt, just under 1/4 cup of olive oil
- Blend until smooth

Sausages and eggs:

- Break eggs into a bowl, add tablespoon of mirrin and a dash or two or Cholula, whisk
- slice up sausages, cook in oil for about three minutes until browned on both sides
- add eggs to sausages, fold together as eggs cook - only takes about a minute
- Tip into a clean glass bowl eggs while are still not quite fully cooked since they'll continue to cook in the bowl

Heat the corn tortillas one at a time (unless you have space for two) in a cast iron pan on a medium high heat - about 60 seconds a side - then transfer to a plate. The goal is to make them warm with maybe a couple of brown spots while staying fully flexible - if they get difficult to fold theyâ€™ve been heated for too long.

To assemble: Sriracha aioli and a quarter of the avocado sauce on each tortilla, topped with a quarter (or less) of the egg and sausage mixture and then add optional cholula.

Give any leftover sausages and eggs to the dog.
