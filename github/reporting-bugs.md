# Reporting bugs in GitHub to GitHub

I found out today (via [this post](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/19988)) about a dedicated interface for reporting bugs in GitHub to GitHub:

https://support.github.com/contact/bug-report

It includes full markdown support, which means you can include animated GIFs that illustrate the bug.

Once reported, you can track the status of your bug reports here:

https://support.github.com/tickets
