# Concatenating strings and newlines in Google Sheets

I was asked if there was a way to run [shot-scraper](https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper) against a list of URLs in a Google Sheet.

I came up with [this example sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VCrG1VzGtdv0DxCdCFf7G8yIurd63O6rvp1FkLyp4kI/edit#gid=0) which uses a formula to code-generate the YAML configuration needed by `shot-scraper multi`:

The formula is:

    =if(isblank(A4), "", "- url: " & A4)

The `&` character is used for string concatenation.

The `if(condition, if-true, if-false)` function is used to return an empty string if the cell is blank, or a concatenated string otherwise.

## Adding newlines to the output text

I decided to try generating this output instead:

```yaml
- url: https://assahbismark.com/
  width: 800
- url: https://datasette.io/
  width: 800
- url: https://www.example.com/
  width: 800
```

My first attempt was to include the newline in the formula - you can do this by hitting Ctrl+Enter while editing the cell:

```
=if(isblank(A2), "", "- url: " & A2 & "
  width: 800")
```
This looks like it does the right thing:

But... when you copy and paste out the result, you get additional unwanted double quotes!

```
"- url: https://assahbismark.com/
  width: 800"
"- url: https://datasette.io/
  width: 800"
"- url: https://www.example.com/
  width: 800"
```
Thanks to [this answer](https://webapps.stackexchange.com/a/104802) on StackOverflow I found a workaround.

Use `char(13)` where you want a newline. This is actually the character code for `\r` rather than `\n` - the result looks like this:

But... when you copy and paste out the column into a VS Code file you get this:
```
- url: https://assahbismark.com/
  width: 800
- url: https://datasette.io/
  width: 800
- url: https://www.example.com/
  width: 800
```
Hitting save in VS Code (for me on my Mac) resulted in a file with `\n` lines in it.
```
% python -c "print(repr(open('/tmp/saved.txt', 'rb').read()))"
b'- url: https://assahbismark.com/\n  width: 800\n- url: https://datasette.io/\n  width: 800\n- url: https://www.example.com/\n  width: 800'
```
You can confirm that the original clipboard text contained `\r` and not `\n` by doing this:

```
% pbpaste | python -c 'print(repr(__import__("sys").stdin.buffer.read()))'
b'- url: https://assahbismark.com/\r  width: 800\n- url: https://datasette.io/\r  width: 800\n- url: https://www.example.com/\r  width: 800'
```
