# Listen to a web page in Mobile Safari

I found a better way to listen to a whole web page through text-to-speech on Mobile Safari today.

Previously I'd been selecting all text on the page manually (an arduous task) and using the "Speak" action menu. It turns out there's a better way.

1. Hit the `aA` button next to the URL bar and select "Show Reader" from the menu
2. Then hit that button _again_ and select "Listen to Page"
3. Hit that button a third time and you can control the Speaking rate, pause and skip forward or backwards by a short amount of time
