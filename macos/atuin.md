# Atuin for zsh shell history in SQLite

[Atuin](https://github.com/ellie/atuin) (via [Rhet Turnbull](https://twitter.com/RhetTurnbull/status/1518942324004319232)) "replaces your existing shell history with a SQLite database". Obviously I had to try this out!

I installed it with Homebrew:

    brew install atuin

Then ran this to add it to my `.zshrc` config:

    echo 'eval "$(atuin init zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc

I restarted my terminal... and now I have a SQLite database full of commands I have run!

The database lives at `~/.local/share/atuin/history.db` (I figured that out with [this TIL](https://til.assahbismark.com/macos/open-files-with-opensnoop)), and can be opened in Datasette.

## Removing the "up" key binding

Atuin hijacks the `Ctrl+R` shortcut to provide an interactive search window, which I really like:

But it also hijacks the Up arrow key, which I didn't like - it interfered with how I usually use that (quickly getting back my previous command and editing it).

[This thread](https://github.com/ellie/atuin/issues/51) in the Atuin issues lead me to a solution - though the fix there put my cursor at the start of the line when I wanted it at the end of the line instead. [This StackExchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/97844) showed me the fix for that.

I edited my `~/.zshrc` file and replaced the `atuin` bit at the bottom with this:

```zsh
eval "$(atuin init zsh)"
# Restore original up binding: https://til.assahbismark.com/macos/atuin
autoload -U history-search-end
zle -N history-beginning-search-backward-end history-search-end
bindkey "^[[A" history-beginning-search-backward-end
```
