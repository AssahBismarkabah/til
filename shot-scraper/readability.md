# Extracting web page content using Readability.js and shot-scraper

[Readability.js](https://github.com/mozilla/readability) is "A standalone version of the readability library used for Firefox Reader View".

I figured out how to use it with [shot-scraper](https://datasette.io/tools/shot-scraper) to extract the core content from a page using the command line.

Here's the recipe:

    shot-scraper javascript https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/24/datasette-061/ "
    async () => {
      const readability = await import('https://cdn.skypack.dev/@mozilla/readability');
      return (new readability.Readability(document)).parse();
    }"

It's using Skypack to [load the module](https://www.skypack.dev/view/@mozilla/readability). Playwright (the tech that powers `shot-scarper`) knows how to execute `async ()` functions and return their results.

This outputs the JSON structure created by Readability directly to the console.
```
% shot-scraper javascript https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/24/datasette-061/ "
    async () => {
      const readability = await import('https://cdn.skypack.dev/@mozilla/readability');
      return (new readability.Readability(document)).parse();
    }"
{
    "title": "Datasette 0.61: The annotated release notes",
    "byline": null,
    "dir": null,
    "lang": "en-gb",
    "content": "<div id=\"readability-page-1\" cla...
```
Piping to `jq keys` shows the keys in the returned object:
```
% shot-scraper javascript https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/24/datasette-061/ "
    async () => {
      const readability = await import('https://cdn.skypack.dev/@mozilla/readability');
      return (new readability.Readability(document)).parse();
    }" | jq keys
[
  "byline",
  "content",
  "dir",
  "excerpt",
  "lang",
  "length",
  "siteName",
  "textContent",
  "title"
]
```

To get just the text content, use `jq .textContent -r` (the `-r` returns the raw string, without the surrounding double quotes):
```
% shot-scraper javascript https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/24/datasette-061/ "
    async () => {
      const readability = await import('https://cdn.skypack.dev/@mozilla/readability');
      return (new readability.Readability(document)).parse();
    }" | jq .textContent -r
I released Datasette 0.61 this morningâ€”closely followed by 0.61.1 to fix a minor bug.
Here are the annotated release notes.

In preparation for Datasette 1.0, this release includes ...
```
I can even pipe it directly into `sqlite-utils` to insert it into a SQLite database table:

```
% shot-scraper javascript https://simonwillison.net/2021/Oct/19/datasette-059/ "
async () => {    
  const readability = await import('https://cdn.skypack.dev/@mozilla/readability');
  return (new readability.Readability(document)).parse();
}" | sqlite-utils insert articles.db articles -
```
